# MacBook Deployment Guide

## Step 1: Download All Files

Copy these files to a new folder on your MacBook:

### Core Application Files:
- `app.py` - Main dashboard application
- `stock_data.py` - Stock data fetching engine
- `technical_analysis.py` - Technical analysis calculations
- `indian_stocks.py` - Stock database with 500+ companies
- `chatbot.py` - AI investment assistant

### Setup Files:
- `setup_requirements.txt` - Python package dependencies
- `setup_macos.sh` - Automated setup script
- `run_dashboard.sh` - Quick start script
- `README_LOCAL_SETUP.md` - Detailed instructions

## Step 2: Quick Setup (Terminal Commands)

```bash
# 1. Create project folder
mkdir indian-stock-dashboard
cd indian-stock-dashboard

# 2. Copy all files to this folder (download from Replit)

# 3. Run setup script
chmod +x setup_macos.sh
./setup_macos.sh

# 4. Start dashboard
./run_dashboard.sh
```

## Step 3: Manual Setup (If Automated Fails)

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv stock_env
source stock_env/bin/activate

# Install packages
pip install streamlit anthropic numpy pandas pandas-ta plotly yfinance python-dotenv

# Create config
mkdir -p .streamlit
echo "[server]
headless = true
address = \"localhost\"
port = 8501" > .streamlit/config.toml

# Run dashboard
streamlit run app.py
```

## Browser Access:
- Dashboard opens at: `http://localhost:8501`

## Performance:
- Loads 1-year data in ~2-3 seconds per stock
- Supports analyzing 5-10 stocks simultaneously
- Charts render instantly with Plotly
- Minimal RAM usage (~100-200MB)

## Troubleshooting:

**Port busy error:** Use `streamlit run app.py --server.port 8502`
**Module errors:** Ensure virtual environment is activated
**Data loading issues:** Check internet connection for Yahoo Finance
**Slow performance:** Start with fewer stocks, add more gradually

The dashboard runs completely locally - no external dependencies except for stock data fetching.
